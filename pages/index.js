The need for an online ID Kit which can be updated as your children grow is really a must especially in the times, we now live in. Add to this the speed in which a childâ€™s information can be texted or emailed to law enforcement and shared with others via social media is a huge advantage compared to the ID Kits that have been given to parents in the past.'>
