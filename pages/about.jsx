          <p>Gods Child ID is a faith-based company created by a parent just like you. The need for an online ID Kit which can be updated as your children grow is really a must especially in the times, we now live in. Add to this the speed in which a child’s information can be emailed to law enforcement or shared with others via social media is a huge advantage compared to the ID Kits that have been given to parents in the past. It saves precious time and takes the guess work out of remembering important aspects about your child during a stressful situation. This service is offered to you for just a little more than a quarter a day, and that’s for up to six children! But we offer you much more than an Online ID Kit. We invite you to join our community, God’s Child ID on Facebook, where you can view ideas and share articles on how we can make it a safer and heathier world for all of our children. See you there!</p>
